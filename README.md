# Citanator
A simple but efficient applicaiton that creates citations by scrapping information from the url provided. Included along with that is the article finder and the AI detector. The article finder searches a database of articles, mainly found in Medium.com and returns them to the user. Users can also check the level of AI content in their papers through the AI detector which is built with the help of an AI detection api. 

Here is the demo: https://www.citanatorweb.netlify.app
